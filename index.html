<h2>Ranked Explained</h2>
  <p id="description">In order to match teams of players of a similar skill level to play with and against each other. <br><br>

    <strong>This is where the ranking system comes in.</strong> <br><br>

    The current League system comprises nine tiers, to indicate the general skill level of players. <br> <br>

    - All apex tiers are consolidated. Tiers under those are split into four divisions each, numbered from
    1 (I), the highest tier, through 4 (IV), the lowest tier. <br><br>

    - Players within each division are ranked using a point system called League Points (LP). <br> <br>

    - Tiers that are composed of divisions additionally require winning a series of games in order to promote to the next tier.
    Players promote and demote from tiers and divisions, based on their League Points.</p>
